Version 0.01:
	Everything. First release, pretty basic, but it worked.

Version 0.02:
	Patch to allow reading from files if specified as arguments applied.

	Cleaned up source file (indenting, comments, etc).

	Started wrapping documentation at 80 chars.

	Added this changelog.

Version 0.03:
	Changed use of getopt_long_only to getopt_long, which should work
	better with non-GNU platforms.
	
	Fixed segfault when given a non-existant file to read.

	Made Imakefile for use with xmkmf. This means that xclip should build
	and install fairly nicely on any system with an X Consortium derived
	X server (nearly all Unix style X servers I would imagine).

	Wrote a decent man page.

Version 0.04:
	Changed use of getopt_long() to XrmParseCommand(), a function in xlib,
	for portability. Apparently System V Unix derived machines don't have
	getopt_long(). XrmParseCommand() is part of xlib, and hence should
	*always* be available. XrmParseCommand is pretty average. It ignores
	ambiguous options (-ver gets ignored, instead of going to -verbose or
	-version). It doesn't do multiple options with one hyphen (-if instead
	of (-i -f), etc.

	Added xclip -out (out mode) and -filter (print stdin back to stdout).

Version 0.05:
	Added -selection option to allow access to XA_SECONDARY and
	XA_CLIPBOARD. Use "-selection secondary", or "-s s"

	Changed email address.

	Added -Wall to C compiler options in Imakefile, fixed up some warnings.

	Updated man page.

Version 0.06:
	Added support for INCR mechanism. This means that -o should be able to
	print out selections that were previously too big and would have
	resulted in a message "Error: Support for format not yet implemented."
	In in mode, using the INCR mechanism means that you can use xclip on
	really big data. It used to work OK on big data, but it is better
	behaved about it now.

	Created xclib.c file to look after the xlib selection and property code
	from xclip.c. This may (or may not) be handy for anyone who wants a
	simple way to use selections without using a widget set or getting
	too involved in doing it themselves with xlib. I know a lot of people
	are using xclip from inside scripts or other programs at the moment,
	perhaps it xclib.c would be allow people to integrate the code into
	their own projects easily.

	All in all, a general cleanup (as I am now semi-competant with C), and
	complete support for the INCR mechanism.
