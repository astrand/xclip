Version 0.01:
	Everything. First release, pretty basic, but it worked.

Version 0.02:
	Patch to allow reading from files if specified as arguments applied.

	Cleaned up source file (indenting, comments, etc).

	Started wrapping documentation at 80 chars.

	Added this changelog.

Version 0.03:
	Changed use of getopt_long_only to getopt_long, which should work
	better with non-GNU platforms.
	
	Fixed segfault when given a non-existant file to read.

	Made Imakefile for use with xmkmf. This means that xclip should build
	and install fairly nicely on any system with an X Consortium derived
	X server (nearly all Unix style X servers I would imagine).

	Wrote a decent man page.

Version 0.04:
	Changed use of getop_long() to XrmParseCommand(), a function in xlib,
	for portability. Apparently System V Unix derived machines don't have
	getopt_long(). XrmParseCommand() is part of xlib, and hence should
	*always* be available. XrmParseCommand is pretty average. It ignores
	ambiguous options (-ver gets ignored, instead of going to -verbose or
	-version). It doesn't do multiple options with one hyphen (-if instead
	of (-i -f), etc.

	Added xclip -out (out mode) and -filter (print stdin back to stdout).

Version 0.05:
	Added -selection option to allow access to XA_SECONDARY and
	XA_CLIPBOARD. Use "-selection secondary", or "-s s"

	Changed email address.

	Added -Wall to C compiler options in Imakefile, fixed up some warnings.

	Updated man page.
