Version 0.01:
	Everything. First release, pretty basic, but it worked.

Version 0.02:
	Patch to allow reading from files if specified as arguments applied.

	Cleaned up source file (indenting, comments, etc).

	Started wrapping documentation at 80 chars.

	Added this changelog.

Version 0.03:
	Changed use of getopt_long_only to getopt_long, which should work
	better with non-GNU platforms.
	
	Fixed segfault when given a non-existant file to read.

	Made Imakefile for use with xmkmf. This means that xclip should build
	and install fairly nicely on any system with an X Consortium derived
	X server (nearly all Unix style X servers I would imagine).

	Wrote a decent man page.
