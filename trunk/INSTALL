BUILDING

You should be able to build and install xclip by running the following commands
in the xclip source directory:

xmkmf			# create the makefile
make			# build the binary
su			# su to root to install
make install		# install xclip
make install.man	# install man page

This should make and install xclip using the configuration (in terms of install
directories, libraries, etc) used to build everything else in your X11
distribution.

REQUIREMENTS

xclip should compile on pretty much any Unix-like system. The requirements to
compile xclip are pretty minimal, if you can compile any X apps at all, you'll
be able to compile xclip.

This means you will need a C compiler, C development environment, xlib
development environment, make, etc. All of these should be available as
packages for most useful distributions.

PLATFORMS

I would really like to get confirmation of all the platforms xclip has compiled
on to list here - I want to make sure it works on all platforms that X11 works
on. If you compile xclip successfully on a platform not listed here, please
email me the details. If you *can't* compile xclip on a platform, please email
me with the problem so I can try to fix it.

* GNU/Linux
* Cygwin
