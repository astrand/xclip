BUILDING
========

You should be able to build and install xclip by running the following commands
in the xclip source directory:

xmkmf			# create the makefile
make			# build the binary
su			# su to root to install
make install		# install xclip
make install.man	# install man page

This should make and install xclip using the configuration (in terms of install
directories, libraries, etc) used to build everything else in your X11
distribution.

REQUIREMENTS
============

xclip should compile on pretty much any unix-like system. The requirements to
compile xclip are pretty minimal, if you can compile any X apps at all, you'll
be able to compile xclip.

This means you will need a C compiler, C development environment, xlib
development environment, make, etc. All of these should be available as
packages for most useful distributions.

PLATFORMS
=========

I've given up trying to compile a list that xclip does work on, because it's
likely that it will change with every version. Rather, please report to me if
you have any trouble compiling, installing and using xclip in any unix-like
system that you feel it should work on.

TESTING
=======

The xctest shell script tests xclip by creating a file, and transferring it
with xclip -i and xclip -o to put it trough xclip, then making sure that
xclip -o returns exactly what we put in with xclip -i with diff. It was written
primarily for my own benefit so that I can quickly test that all xclip features
are working correctly after I make a change. However, I have included it to
help out anyone who may be modifying the xclip code themselves.

Basically, when you run xctest, you shouln't see any extra output from diff
inbetween each test (because the input and output should be identical).
