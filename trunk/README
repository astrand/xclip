WHAT IS XCLIP?

xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system with an
X11 implementation. It provides an interface to the X selection (the clipboard)
from the command line. It can read data from standard in or a file and place it
in the X selection for pasting into other X applicationss. xclip can also print
the X selection to standard out, which can be piped to a file or another
program.

USING XCLIP

Here are some nifty things to do with xclip:

	Copy your uptime into the clipboard for pasting:
	uptime | xclip

	Copy your password file for pasting:
	xclip /etc/passwd

	Save the selected example code from your web browser to a file:
	xclip -o > helloword.c

	In command mode in vim, select some lines of text, then press shift-:
	for and ex prompt, and use this command to copy the selected lines
	of text to the X selection:
	!xclip -f

FEATURES

* Reads data piped to standard in or files given as arguments
* Prints contents of selection to standard out
* Connects to the X display in DISPLAY, or specified with -display host:0 
* Waits for pastes in the background

CAN I HELP?

Glad you asked! xclip is my first project in C, and hence my first encounter
with xlib, make, xmkmf and friends. So, if you speak C or xlib, please check
out the code, and submit any comments/fixes.

VERSION

0.04 - I don't think there are any major features missing any more, just some
more testing and tweaking to be done. Should very portable now, I don't think
xclip uses anything that anyone with a working X11 will be missing.

There have been a *lot* of *major* changes since 0.03 (see CHANGES), so I'm
sure there will be some bugs in this release. Please report them! Probably best
not to include this release in distributions at this stage. I'm hoping to come
up with a very stable (dare I say "finished") version soon if this release goes
well which I *will* want in as many distributions as possible!
