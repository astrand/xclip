WHAT IS XCLIP?

xclip is a utility that is designed to be run from the command line on a *n?x
system. It reads input from standard in (usually piped to it) and puts it in
the X selection of an X server for pasting into any X app with your middle
mouse button. I primarily use a GNOME setup, and xclip allows better
integration with command line programs. For example, it's handy if you need to
email the output of a command to someone - you could email a whois record with
xclip by running "whois domain.com | xclip", then middle clicking in an email.
It can also read an entire file into the X selection for pasting into another
document, e.g. "xclip /proc/cpuinfo".


I am somewhat surprised that a utility like this hasn't been implemented before
- am I missing something? If not, I feel xclip is a pretty "core" utility that
most people would use. It's in the Unix spirit of a simple program to add to
the toolbox, to integrate with other tools. If no alternative to xclip exists,
I'd like to see to become a pretty standard X tool.

FEATURES

* Reads data piped to standard in or files given as arguments
* Connects to the X display in DISPLAY, or specified with -display host:0 
* Waits for pastes in the background

CAN I HELP?

Glad you asked! xclip is my first project in C, and hence my first encounter
with xlib, make, xmkmf and friends. So, if you speak C or xlib, please check
out the code, and submit any comments/fixes.

VERSION

0.03 - Getting pretty usable. Should be pretty portable now, has decent man
pages, etc. Only a few more things to do until I'm ready to declare it
"finished".
