WHAT IS XCLIP?
==============

xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system with an
X11 implementation. It provides an interface to X selections ("the clipboard")
from the command line. It can read data from standard in or a file and place it
in an X selection for pasting into other X applications. xclip can also print
an X selection to standard out, which can then be redirected to a file or
another program.

USING XCLIP
===========

Here are some ideas for things you can do with xclip:

	Copy your uptime into the selection for pasting:
	uptime | xclip

	Copy your password file for pasting:
	xclip /etc/passwd

	Save some text you have Edit | Copied in a web browser:
	xclip -o -sel clip > webpage.txt

	Open a URL selected in an email client
	mozilla `xclip -o`

	Copy XA_PRIMARY to XA_CLIPBOARD
	xclip -o | xclip -sel clip

	In command mode in vim, select some lines of text, then press shift-:
	for an ex prompt, and use this command to copy the selected lines of
	text to the primary X selection:
	!xclip -f

FEATURES
========

* Reads data piped to standard in or files given as arguments
* Prints contents of selection to standard out
* Accesses the XA_PRIMARY, XA_SECONDARY or XA_CLIPBOARD selection
* Accesses the cut-buffers
* Supports the INCR mechanism for large transfers
* Connects to the X display in $DISPLAY, or specified with -display host:0 
* Waits for selection requests in the background

SELECTIONS
==========

For a good overview of what selections are about, have a look at 
<http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt>. Short version:

* XA_PRIMARY contains the last text you highlighted
* Middle click pastes XA_PRIMARY
* XA_CLIPBOARD contains text explicitly copied with Edit | Copy, Ctrl-C etc.
* Edit | Paste pastes XA_CLIPBOARD
* xclip uses XA_PRIMARY unless you specify otherwise with -selection 

CAN I HELP?
===========

Glad you asked! At this stage, I'm pretty happy with the features and
implementation, so if you have anything at all that should be done, I want to
hear about it. Doesn't matter how small, compiler warnings, segfaults, spelling
mistakes, whatever, I want to get it sorted out. xclip is not a big project,
I'd like to get all these things sorted out and then declare it "complete".

VERSION
=======

Please email me about problems, experiences, patches, fixes, etc. Also, please
drop me an email to let me know if you are going to feature xclip on a website,
in a publication or in a distribution. Obviously, you are encouraged to do
these things, I'd just be interested to know, that's all.
