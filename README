WHAT IS XCLIP?
==============

xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system with an
X11 implementation. It provides an interface to X selections ("the clipboard")
from the command line. It can read data from standard in or a file and place it
in an X selection for pasting into other X applications. xclip can also print
an X selection to standard out, which can then be redirected to a file or
another program.

USING XCLIP
===========

Here are some ideas for things you can do with xclip:

	Copy your uptime into the selection for pasting:
	uptime | xclip

	Copy your password file for pasting:
	xclip /etc/passwd

	Save some text you have Edit | Copied in a web browser:
	xclip -o -sel clip > webpage.txt

	Open a URL selected in an email client
	mozilla `xclip -o`

	Copy XA_PRIMARY to XA_CLIPBOARD
	xclip -o | xclip -sel clip

	In command mode in vim, select some lines of text, then press shift-:
	for an ex prompt, and use this command to copy the selected lines of
	text to the primary X selection:
	!xclip -f

FEATURES
========

* Reads data piped to standard in or files given as arguments
* Prints contents of selection to standard out
* Accesses the XA_PRIMARY, XA_SECONDARY or XA_CLIPBOARD selection
* Accesses the cut-buffers
* Supports the INCR mechanism for large transfers
* Connects to the X display in $DISPLAY, or specified with -display host:0 
* Waits for selection requests in the background

SELECTIONS
==========

For a good overview of what selections are about, have a look at 
<http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt>. Short version:

* XA_PRIMARY contains the last text you highlighted
* Middle click pastes XA_PRIMARY
* XA_CLIPBOARD contains text explicitly copied with Edit | Copy, Ctrl-C etc.
* Edit | Paste pastes XA_CLIPBOARD
* xclip uses XA_PRIMARY unless you specify otherwise with -selection 

CAN I HELP?
===========

Glad you asked! At this stage, I'm pretty happy with the features and
implementation, so if you have anything at all that should be done, I want to
hear about it. Doesn't matter how small, compiler warnings, segfaults, spelling
mistakes, whatever, I want to get it sorted out. xclip is not a big project,
I'd like to get all these things sorted out and then declare it "complete".

VERSION

Please email me about problems, experiences, patches, fixes, etc. Also, please
drop me an email to let me know if you are going to feature xclip on a website,
in a publication or in a distribution. Obviously, you are encouraged to do
these things, I'd just be interested to know, that's all.
