.TH XCLIP 1
.SH NAME
xclip \- command line interface to X selections (clipboard)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xclip
[OPTION] [FILE]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Copies from standard input, or from one or more files, and makes the data
available as an X selection for pasting into X applications.
Pastes current X selection to standard out.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-in\fR
.
Copy text into X selection from standard input or files. (Default unless it
would read from a tty.)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-out\fR
.
Paste the selection to standard out. (Default when no files are specified and
standard input is a tty.)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-filter\fR
.
Copy text into the X selection and also print it out to standard out,
unmodified. Handy for pipelines. This does not (yet) work with files for input.
Not compatible with verbosity levels above \(lqsilent\(rq (the default) as
xclip would not exit after making the copy and could hang a pipeline.
.TP
\fB\-selection\fR \fIselection\fR
.
Specify which X selection to use, options are PRIMARY (default),
CLIPBOARD, or SECONDARY. See discussion in
\fBAbout Selections\fP
below.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-clipboard\fR
Shorthand for \(lq-selection clipboard\(rq. 
.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fIfmt\fR, \fB\-target\fR \fIfmt\fR
.
Specify a particular data format to request (out mode) or advertise (in mode)
using the given target \fIfmt\fR (e.g., image/jpeg). The default target is
UTF8_STRING. If, during output, that is not available, xclip will fallback to
STRING.
.
Note: xclip can only specify one target data format.
.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-TARGETS\fR
.
Show all formats that the current selection owner is willing to send for an
output (paste). Use this to pick a format for \fB-t\fR \fIfmt\fR.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-rmlastnl\fR
.
If the last character of the selection is a newline, remove it. Newline
characters that are not the last character in the selection are not affected.
If the selection does not end with a newline character, this option has no
effect. This option is useful for copying one-line output of programs like
\fBpwd\fR to the clipboard to paste it again into the command prompt without
executing the line immediately due to the newline character \fBpwd\fR appends.
Can be used on input or ouput.
.TP
\fB\-loops\fR \fIn\fP
.
Given a natural number \fIn\fP, wait for \fIn\fP selection requests (pastes)
before clearing the selection and exiting. A value of 0 (default) causes xclip
to wait for an unlimited number of requests until another application \[em]
possibly another invocation of xclip \[em] takes ownership of the selection
(performs a copy). Input mode only.
.
.TP
\fB\-display\fR \fIdpy:n\fR
.
X display to use (e.g. \(lqlocalhost:0\(rq). If omitted, xclip defaults to the value in
$\fBDISPLAY\fR.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-help\fR
Show quick summary of options
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-version\fR
Show version information.
.TP
\fB\-silent\fR
.
Errors only, no informational output. (Default). In input mode (copy), forks
a background process to wait for requests and returns to command line.
.TP
\fB\-quiet\fR
Run in the foreground and show informational messages on the terminal.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-verbose\fR
Run in the foreground and provide a running commentary of what xclip is doing.
.TP
\fB\-debug\fR
Run in the foreground and print garrulous debugging output.
.TP
\fB\-sensitive\fR
.
Clear sensitive data from selection buffer after being pasted once.
This is currently implemented as \fB-wait 50\fP. See \fBNOTES\fR
.TP
\fB\-wait\fR \fIn\fR
.
After the first paste, wait for \fIn\fR milliseconds. If a subsequent paste
request arrives before the timer expires, reset the timer. Once the timer
expires, the selection buffer is cleared so the data cannot be pasted again.
.
.TP
\fB\-noutf8\fR
Operate in legacy (i.e. non UTF-8) mode for backwards compatibility.
(Use this option only when really necessary, as the old behavior was broken).
.
.PP
Xclip was designed to allow tighter integration of X applications and command
line programs. Xclip can be in either input mode (copy) or output mode (paste)
and will typically do the right thing without needing \fB-i\fP or \fB-o\fP to
be specified. Filenames on the commandline are always used for input. When the
input is from a file or a pipeline, xclip copies text (or binary data) in to
the X selection and forks a daemon to makes the data available to other X
applications for pasting. When no input is detected, or if \fB-o\fP is used,
xclip will print the contents of the current selection to standard output. This
is commonly piped into other commands, redirected to a file, or used in command
substitution. This is the default when no files are specified and stdin is a
tty (the user's keyboard).

The default action for \fB-in\fP (copy) is to silently fork a temporary daemon
and appear to exit immediately. The daemon waits in the background for X
selection requests (pastes) and sends the data to other applications. Xclip's
daemon exits silently when another X application performs a copy (technically,
when xclip \(lqloses ownership of the selection\(rq). One can use the
\fB\-verbose\fR option to prevent xclip from backgrounding itself to see if and
when it receives selection requests from other X applications.

Options can be abbreviated as long as they remain unambiguous. For example, it
is possible to use \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-disp\fR instead of \fB\-display\fR as no
other option begins with the letter 'd'. Any single character option listed in
this manual, will also work, even if ambiguous. For example, \fB\-v\fR will
always be short for \fB\-verbose\fR (rather than the less useful
\fB\-version\fR). Due to a fluke, using an ambiguous option, or forgetting to
include a mandatory argument, will give an elliptical response: \(lqNo such
file or directory.\(rq

Note that only the first character of the selection specified with the
\fB\-selection\fR option is important. This means that \(lqp\(rq, \(lqsec\(rq
and \(lqclip\(rq would have the same effect as using PRIMARY,
SECONDARY or CLIPBOARD respectively.

.SS About selections

The X Windowing System differs from Apple MacOS\(tm and Microsoft Windows\(tm
in that there are multiple clipboards (called \(lqselections\(rq) available.
Only two are in common use nowadays. The \fBPRIMARY\fP selection (the default
in xclip) is mainly used for quick text transfers. For example, highlighting
with a mouse does an implicit copy to PRIMARY in most applications and,
traditionally, the middle mouse button does a paste.

The \fBCLIPBOARD\fP selection is for data explicitly copied by the user,
including binary objects, such as images. Applications use the CLIPBOARD when
copying with menu options or the keyboard (Control-C / Control-V). Xclip allows
the shortcut \fB-c\fP to mean \fB-selection\fP \fBclipboard\fP. (Ecumenically,
xclip also accepts \fIxsel\fP's \fB-b\fP option as a synonym for \fB-c\fP).

.SS About targets

Each selection in X can have multiple \(lqtargets\(rq available. Each target is
a different data format. For example, a single clipboard selection might be
available as UTF8_STRING, STRING, text/html, image/jpeg, and application/pdf.
Which targets are available and what they mean is up to the copying
application. When multiple targets are available, the application that did the
copy provides a list of targets (data types) that it is willing to convert to
upon request. In xclip, one can see all targets currently available for pasting
with \fB-T\fP and pick one with \fB-t\fP.

If you are using bash(1), then you can use tab completion to choose a target
interactively. After typing \fBxclip -t <space>\fP press the \fB<tab>\fP key
twice to be shown a list of currently available targets.

When inputting the selection (copying), xclip can only specify a single target
per selection. (This may change in the future). If no target is specified, then
xclip's default is UTF8_STRING. Output (pasting) works the same, with one
change: if the default target, UTF8_STRING, is not found, then STRING is tried.

For more information about target atoms refer to ICCCM section 2.6.2.

replaced with left\~(\[lq]) or right\~(\[rq]) quotes, as appropriate. The
result is copied to both the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD so that text that has been
highlighted with the mouse can be easily replaced with Control-V (paste).

.SH USAGE NOTES

.SS Sensitive data

Using the \fB\-sensitive\fR option will clear the selection buffer of the
sensitive information 50 milliseconds after it has been pasted, effectively only
allowing the selection to be pasted once. In some instances this may be too low
and will prevent pasting. If this is the case, or if the user needs to be able
to paste more than once for some other reason, they may use \fB\-wait\fR \fIn\fR
instead. \fB\-wait\fR is the same as \fB\-sensitive\fR, except it allows one to
adjust the time to wait before clearing the selection to be \fIn\fR
milliseconds.
.PP
Ideally, \fB\-sensitive\fR would allow exactly one paste and not need a
timeout, but due to subtleties in the way the X clipboard protocol works, doing
so is not as simple as it may seem.

.SS SECONDARY and BUFFERCUT selections
Historically, there were other selections such as SECONDARY and BUFFERCUT. Very
few applications nowadays make use of them. They are fully supported by Xclip,
if you so desire. For example, to swap the PRIMARY and SECONDARY selections,
you could do this:

.EX
$ xclip \-sel s | xclip \-sel b
$ xclip | xclip \-sel s
$ xclip \-sel b | xclip
.EE

Note that the BUFFERCUT selection uses an older transfer method and has
various limitations, such as, inability to choose a TARGET and a maximum
amount of data (\[~=] 16 MB).

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH KNOWN BUGS
.PP
xclip is not fully ICCCM compliant. For example, the TIMESTAMP isn't set and
MULTIPLE does not work.
.PP
Only one target type can be chosen. It would be useful to let users pick a
different type for each input file.
.PP
Making users specify the MIME type of files by hand is silly. Xclip ought to be
able to automatically set the target appropriately using `file \-\-brief
\-\-mime-type` on any files provided on the command line.
.PP
Xclip cannot automatically convert between data types. For example, if the user
has specified \fB-t image/png\fP as input, xclip will not correctly handle a
request for a different target, such as \(lqimage/jpeg\(rq. Currently xclip
sends the same data willy-nilly regardless of what was requested. It ought to,
at the least, return an error if it cannot comply.
