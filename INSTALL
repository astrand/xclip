BUILDING
========

You should be able to build and install xclip by running the following commands
in the xclip source directory:

make			# build the binary
su			# su to root to install
make install		# install binary and manual pages

This should make xclip and install it under `/usr` prefix using the most common
configuration.  If you need more control over the process, the following
variables may be provided either via environment or in `config.mk` user
configuration file:

* `CC` - compiler, defauts to `gcc`
* `CFLAGS` - compiler flags, default to `-Wall`
* `LDFLAGS` - linker flags, empty by default
* `PREFIX` - system prefix, defaults to `/usr`
* `BINDIR` - location of binaries, defaults to `$PREFIX/bin`
* `MANDIR` - location of manual pages, defaults to `$PREFIX/share/man`
* `DESTDIR` - temporary installation location, for packagers
* `INSTALL` - `install` executable, defaults to `install`
* `INSTALL_PROGRAM` - binary installation command
* `INSTALL_DATA` - data installation command
* `INSTALL_DIR` - directory installation command
* `STRIP` - flag for `install` to strip binaries, defaults to `-s`

REQUIREMENTS
============

xclip should compile on pretty much any unix-like system. The requirements to
compile xclip are pretty minimal, if you can compile any X apps at all, you'll
be able to compile xclip.

This means you will need a C compiler, C development environment, xlib
development environment, make, etc. All of these should be available as
packages for most useful distributions.

PLATFORMS
=========

xclip should compile and work on any unix-like platform, I have taken great
effort to avoid using anything that isn't absolutely standard.

I have decided that it's not practical to compile a list of specific platforms
that xclip works on, but it has been known to work on GNU/Linux, Solaris,
Cygwin and Irix. If you are able to get xclip working on a different platform,
or have any problems getting it to work on a platform you feel it should work
on, please drop me an email - I'd be interested to know.

TESTING
=======

The xctest shell script tests xclip by creating a file, and transferring it
with xclip -i and xclip -o to put it trough xclip, then making sure that
xclip -o returns exactly what we put in with xclip -i with diff. It was written
primarily for my own benefit so that I can quickly test that all xclip features
are working correctly after I make a change. However, I have included it to
help out anyone who may be modifying the xclip code themselves.

Basically, when you run xctest, you shouln't see any extra output from diff
inbetween each test (because the input and output should be identical).
