Version 0.09: (Baruch Even)
	Changed dir to / when staying running so that the current directory can
	be umounted if necessary.


Version 0.08:
	Remove all event loops from xclib fuctions, to allow xclib to be
	integrated into general-purpose event loops of other software more
	easily.

	Started using debian.org for email and website.


Version 0.07:
	Not a lot of changes in terms of features, but tonnes of bug and
	portability fixes, as well as general code cleanup.
	
	Fixed a segfault problem with errperror in v0.06. Can't believe I
	didn't notice it before I released it.

	Cleaned up the code, hopefully for complete compatibilty with more C
	compilers and platforms. xclip compiles without warning on my Debian
	GNU/Linux development platform with gcc -Wall -W -pedantic -ansi
	-Wtraditional -Wundef -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wbad-function-cast
	-Wcast-qual -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings -Wconversion -Wsign-compare
	-Waggregate-return -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes
	-Wmissing-declarations -Wredundant-decls -Wnested-externs -Winline

	I figure if it compiles without warning with those options, it should
	compile OK on pretty much any suitable platform (see README for what
	counts as a suitable platform). I wish GCC just had a -Wanal-retentive
	option...

	I discovered the wonders of Electric Fence, so I was able to fix up
	some memory problems that didn't cause problems before, but probably
	wouldn't have helped things either.

	I rewrote the way a few things work. For example, xclip doesn't store
	the selection data in strings any more, but rather just in allocated
	memory of known length, so you can now copy and paste data with nulls
	in it. It's probably not recommended though, gtk doesn't seem to read
	beyond the first null byte.
	
	I have successfully used xclip to copy and paste a 500k PNG image, it
	came out identical (same md5sum), so it's fairly robust in terms of
	the size and nature of the data that it will handle.


Version 0.06:
	Added support for INCR mechanism. This means that -o should be able to
	print out selections that were previously too big and would have
	resulted in a message "Error: Support for format not yet implemented."
	In in mode, using the INCR mechanism means that you can use xclip on
	really big data. It used to work OK on big data, but it is better
	behaved about it now.

	Created xclib.c file to look after the xlib selection and property code
	from xclip.c. This may (or may not) be handy for anyone who wants a
	simple way to use selections without using a widget set or getting
	too involved in doing it themselves with xlib. I know a lot of people
	are using xclip from inside scripts or other programs at the moment,
	perhaps it xclib.c would be allow people to integrate the code into
	their own projects easily.

	All in all, a general cleanup (as I am now semi-competant with C), and
	complete support for the INCR mechanism.


Version 0.05:
	Added -selection option to allow access to XA_SECONDARY and
	XA_CLIPBOARD. Use "-selection secondary", or "-s s"

	Changed email address.

	Added -Wall to C compiler options in Imakefile, fixed up some warnings.

	Updated man page.


Version 0.04:
	Changed use of getopt_long() to XrmParseCommand(), a function in xlib,
	for portability. Apparently System V Unix derived machines don't have
	getopt_long(). XrmParseCommand() is part of xlib, and hence should
	*always* be available. XrmParseCommand is pretty average. It ignores
	ambiguous options (-ver gets ignored, instead of going to -verbose or
	-version). It doesn't do multiple options with one hyphen (-if instead
	of (-i -f), etc.

	Added xclip -out (out mode) and -filter (print stdin back to stdout).


Version 0.03:
	Changed use of getopt_long_only to getopt_long, which should work
	better with non-GNU platforms.
	
	Fixed segfault when given a non-existant file to read.

	Made Imakefile for use with xmkmf. This means that xclip should build
	and install fairly nicely on any system with an X Consortium derived
	X server (nearly all Unix style X servers I would imagine).

	Wrote a decent man page.


Version 0.02:
	Patch to allow reading from files if specified as arguments applied.

	Cleaned up source file (indenting, comments, etc).

	Started wrapping documentation at 80 chars.

	Added this changelog.


Version 0.01:
	Everything. First release, pretty basic, but it worked.
